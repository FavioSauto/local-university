# Local University

## Description

This project is a complete redesign from a local and public university (or College, for the Americans) in my city, I started thinking about this project when I saw its webpage 3 years ago and it was horrible, then they redesign it like a year ago and in my personal opinion it's not quite well as it could be. So I did a little redesign in Figma of three art boards to start programming and see where this project goes.

In time I will be posting the must, should and nice to have features. Enjoy the code, and if you are someone from that university feel free to use this code to optimize and improve your web :).
